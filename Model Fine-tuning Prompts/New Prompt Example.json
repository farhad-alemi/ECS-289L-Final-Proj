This ensures that the EdDSA session key is stored securely.\n\n2. **Secure Memory Allocation:**\n   - The `rawmpi` buffer is now allocated in secure memory, addressing the concern regarding potential side-channel attacks when the EdDSA session key is exposed during the signing process.\n\nBy modifying the code to allocate the buffer in secure memory, it helps protect the EdDSA session key from being exposed to potential side-channel attacks, thereby enhancing the overall security of the cryptographic operation."
